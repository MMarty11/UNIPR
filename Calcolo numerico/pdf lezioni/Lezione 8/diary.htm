help axis
 <strong>axis</strong>  Control axis scaling and appearance.
    <strong>axis</strong>([XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX]) sets scaling for the x- and y-axes
       on the current plot.
    <strong>axis</strong>([XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX ZMIN ZMAX]) sets the scaling for the
       x-, y- and z-axes on the current 3-D plot.
    <strong>axis</strong>([XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX ZMIN ZMAX CMIN CMAX]) sets the
       scaling for the x-, y-, z-axes and color scaling limits on
       the current axis (see CAXIS). 
    V = <strong>axis</strong> returns a row vector containing the scaling for the
       current plot.  If the current view is 2-D, V has four
       components; if it is 3-D, V has six components.
 
    <strong>axis</strong> AUTO  returns the axis scaling to its default, automatic
       mode where, for each dimension, 'nice' limits are chosen based
       on the extents of all line, surface, patch, and image children.
    <strong>axis</strong> MANUAL  freezes the scaling at the current limits, so that if
       HOLD is turned on, subsequent plots will use the same limits.
    <strong>axis</strong> TIGHT  sets the axis limits to the range of the data.
    <strong>axis</strong> FILL  sets the axis limits and PlotBoxAspectRatio so that
       the axis fills the position rectangle.  This option only has
       an effect if PlotBoxAspectRatioMode or DataAspectRatioMode are
       manual.
 
    <strong>axis</strong> IJ  puts MATLAB into its "matrix" axes mode.  The coordinate
       system origin is at the upper left corner.  The i axis is
       vertical and is numbered from top to bottom.  The j axis is
       horizontal and is numbered from left to right.
    <strong>axis</strong> XY  puts MATLAB into its default "Cartesian" axes mode.  The
       coordinate system origin is at the lower left corner.  The x
       axis is horizontal and is numbered from left to right.  The y
       axis is vertical and is numbered from bottom to top.
 
    <strong>axis</strong> EQUAL  sets the aspect ratio so that equal tick mark
       increments on the x-,y- and z-axis are equal in size. This
       makes SPHERE(25) look like a sphere, instead of an ellipsoid.
    <strong>axis</strong> IMAGE  is the same as <strong>axis</strong> EQUAL except that the plot
       box fits tightly around the data.
    <strong>axis</strong> SQUARE  makes the current axis box square in size.
    <strong>axis</strong> NORMAL  restores the current axis box to full size and
        removes any restrictions on the scaling of the units.
        This undoes the effects of <strong>axis</strong> SQUARE and <strong>axis</strong> EQUAL.
    <strong>axis</strong> VIS3D  freezes aspect ratio properties to enable rotation of
        3-D objects and overrides stretch-to-fill.
 
    <strong>axis</strong> OFF  turns off all axis labeling, tick marks and background.
    <strong>axis</strong> ON  turns axis labeling, tick marks and background back on.
 
    <strong>axis</strong>(H,...) changes the axes handles listed in vector H.

help subplot
 <strong>subplot</strong> Create axes in tiled positions.
    H = <strong>subplot</strong>(m,n,p), or <strong>subplot</strong>(mnp), breaks the Figure window
    into an m-by-n matrix of small axes, selects the p-th axes for
    the current plot, and returns the axes handle.  The axes are
    counted along the
